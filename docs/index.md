## Purpose

A set of 'one click install' test suites with increasing functionality, comprising templates, resources and YoutTube videos.

I have collated these into their appropriate test suites so that they run out of the box. With highly commented code and reference links, it will enable developers/testers to use and learn about testing.

## Test Suites

- TEST_SUITE_00 A basic src folder wired to PyTest with custom logging and pytest-sugar console formating.#
- TEST_SUITE_02 as above but with a large number of ready made test templates demoing how to use PyTest along with templates for Mocking and Patching.
- TEST_SUITE_02 as above with API testing and Playwright e2e/functional testing.
- TEST_SUITE_03 as above with Behavior Driven testing that enables the use of native English test requiment files to be wired to PyTest. Enables all stakeholders to work on these 'feature' test files.
- TEST_SUITE_DJANGO is its own unique testing suite built from a range of sources.
- TEST_SUITE_HYPOTHESIS is a property based test suite that can provide templates and resources on how to use property based testing.
