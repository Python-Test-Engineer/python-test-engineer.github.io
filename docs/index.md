## Purpose

A set of 'one click install' test suites with increasing functionality, comprising templates, resources and YouTube videos.

I have collated these into their appropriate test suites so that they run out of the box. With highly commented code and reference links, it will enable developers/testers to use and learn about testing.

## Test Suites

- TEST_SUITE_00_MINIMAL - a basic src folder wired to PyTest with custom logging and pytest-sugar console formating.#
- TEST_SUITE_01_PYTEST - as above but with a large number of ready made test templates demoing how to use PyTest along with templates for Mocking and Patching.
- TEST_SUITE_02_API_PLAYWRIGHT - as above with API testing and Playwright e2e/functional testing.
- TEST_SUITE_03_BDD - as above with Behavior Driven testing that enables the use of native English test requirement files to be wired to PyTest and Behave Framework. BDD enables all stakeholders to work on these 'feature' test files in plain English which are then translated to Python test code.
- TEST_SUITE_04_DATA_PIPELINES - is a standalone test suite for data transofrmation services based on Pydantic V2 to create strongly typed and validated classes for serialization/deserialization.
- TEST_SUITE__05_DJANGO is its own unique testing suite built from a range of sources.
- TEST_SUITE_06_HYPOTHESIS is a standalone property based test suite that can provide templates and resources on how to use property based testing.
