# PyTest Basic







## Set up


This uses TEST_SUITE_00 and is a simple wiring of src folder for your code and an tests folder for PyTest.

![test-stuite](../assets/images/github-test-suite-00.png ){:style="width:520px;border-radius:10%;border: 5px solid #555;"}

There is custom logging defined in pytest.ini that outputs to a `log` folder.

- move to `TEST_SUITE_00` folder and 
```
pip install -r requiements_00.txt
```



## Tests

pytest-sugar has been installed to provide prettier console output.

```
python -m pytest 

python -m pytest -vs
```
