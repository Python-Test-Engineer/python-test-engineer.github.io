A compilation of various soruces in one project.

Based on a TDD video series of Django by [Ssali Jonathan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7jM6XNLTIY&list=PLEt8Tae2spYlVZUBBEE9PtX-NXk_hw7o4&index=1){:target="_blank"}, I have extended it to include a PyTest folder as well as additional Django Unit Tests.

## orm

Based on a TDD video series of Django by [BugBytes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-2EBeDYMIbQXKsyNweppuFptuogJe2L-){:target="_blank"}, the code for the 18+ videos was not included in the repo so I have added files for each of the videos.

It uses django-extensions, [django-extensions](https://pypi.org/project/django-extensions/){:target="_blank"}, which offers the ability to run `manage.py runscript <file_name_but_not_py_extension>`, as if in a shell.

Custom Commands to load data, SQL queries, transactions are also included and I have extended the code to include other useful utilities, as well as some relevant tests.

I have added dditional tests from the Django Docs are also included.

## stores

Based on [Very Academy - Ecommerce](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOLrQ9Pn6caxY4Q1U9RjO1bulQp5NDYS_){:target="_blank"}, this offers variations on testing.

## filemanager

A small app concerned with file uploading and management, this offers some more examples of testing with UnitTest and PyTest.
