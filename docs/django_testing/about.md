-  Ssali Jonathan - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn3Yjea5KCI&list=PLEt8Tae2spYlVZUBBEE9PtX-NXk_hw7o4 for the TDD approach to building the `posts` app. This gives a basis for many good tests. I have transported a few for demonstation purposes in `pytest_tests`. (PyTest searches for all test files with test_ or whatever is specified in the pytest.ini file in root).
